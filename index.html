		<p>As an avid sports fan, I like to maintain an updated list of the top players in my two favorite sports, the NBA and the NFL. It is a fun and challenging
			 excercise to complete. It makes me stay up to date with how things are going in both leagues and can provide me a good snapshot of previous seasons. When it comes
			 to these lists, there is a lot of different factors I take into account. The main of which are previous postseason peformance as well as current season performance. 
			 Then, there is some other stuff to consider like durability and personality. I hope you agree with a lot of my choices!
